# Photo-Sharing-App

This is a Photo-Sharing App, sort of like a mini Instagram. I built it using MEAN Stack( MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJs) in addition
to CSS and HTML and some Material Design.
 
Some of the functionalities include:
- Registering a new user
- Logging in and logging out
- Upload and post photos
- Post Comments
- Like a photos and show how many likes each photo has
- See the most recent added photo
- See the most commented photo
- See user's current activity
- An Activities feed that allow you to see all users' actions.

--> Not the most beautiful design, I was mainly interested in the functionality.
