# Photo-Sharing-App

This is a Photo-Sharing App, sort of like a mini Instagram. I built it using MEAN Stack( MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJs) in addition
to CSS and HTML and some Material Design.
 
Some of the functionalities include:
- Registering a new user
- Logging in and logging out
- Upload and post photos
- Post Comments
- Like a photos and show how many likes each photo has
- See the most recent added photo
- See the most commented photo
- See user's current activity
- An Activities feed that allow you to see all users' actions.

DISCLAIMER: Not the most beautiful design, I was mainly interested in the functionality. Also, this file is missing he node modules.I didn't upload them here since they are very big and contain a lot of files. . If you would like to run the app, all you need to do is install node in your computer, then on the terminal navigate to the directory where you saved my app and call "npm install" , that will read the dependencies of the package.js file and will install the require modules. Let me know if you need any help.

Thank you, 
Tuan
